<!--
    This is a custom Angular component tag.
    It inserts the 'app-nav' component into this part of the template.
    The 'app-nav' component typically represents the navigation bar (header or menu) of the application.
    Angular allows you to reuse components like this to keep your code modular and organized.
-->
<app-nav></app-nav>

<!--
    A container div is used to wrap the content and give it a structured layout.
    The class "container" is likely from a CSS framework like Bootstrap, which provides predefined styles for layout.
    The inline style "margin-top: 100px;" adds 100px of spacing at the top of the container, likely to offset the content
    below the navigation bar or to ensure a consistent look across different screen sizes.
-->
<div class="container" style="margin-top: 100px;">
    
    <!--
        A standard unordered list (<ul>) is being created to display a list of users.
        Each user is rendered as a list item (<li>).
    -->
    <ul>

        <!--
            This line is a structural directive that loops through the 'users' array (or iterable) from the component's data.
            '@for' indicates a loop in this template syntax (it's not typical Angular syntax, so it could be a variant of
            a framework or extension you're using, like Blazor, Razor, or similar).
            It iterates over the 'users' collection and tracks each user by their unique 'id'.
            'track user.id' optimizes the DOM rendering by ensuring each user is tracked based on their 'id', improving efficiency.
        -->
        @for (user of users; track user.id) {
            
            <!--
                Each user in the 'users' array will be rendered inside a <li> tag.
                {{user.id}} and {{user.userName}} are Angular interpolation bindings.
                - {{user.id}} displays the user's ID.
                - {{user.userName}} displays the user's name.
                These values are dynamically pulled from the 'user' object.
            -->
            <li>
                {{user.id}} - {{user.userName}}
            </li>
        }
