<!--
    This is a custom Angular component tag.
    It inserts the 'app-nav' component into this part of the template.
    The 'app-nav' component typically represents the navigation bar (header or menu) of the application.
    Angular allows you to reuse components like this to keep your code modular and organized.
-->
<app-nav></app-nav>

<!--
    A container div is used to wrap the content and give it a structured layout.
    The class "container" is likely from a CSS framework like Bootstrap, which provides predefined styles for layout.
    The inline style "margin-top: 100px;" adds 100px of spacing at the top of the container, likely to offset the content
    below the navigation bar or to ensure a consistent look across different screen sizes.
-->
<div class="container" style="margin-top: 100px;">
    <app-home></app-home>
</div>
